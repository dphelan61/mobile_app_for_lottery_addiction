    "# Logic Development for Mobile App Combatting Lottery Addiction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll be developing the logic for a mobile app that would be built and used for helping folks overcome gambling addiction, particularly focusing on the lottery.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using the 6/49 lottery (see below for more info) to provide users answers to the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize?\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play X number of tickets?\n",
    "- What is the probability of having at least X winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "More info on 6/49 lottery: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_6/49\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to developing the above scenarios to show folks the probability of meeting the criteria above, we'll also be looking at historical data from the 6/49 lottery provided by kaggle. A link to the data is below:\n",

    "## Quick Note about the 6/49 Lottery\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 6/49 lottery, 6 numbers are drawn from a set of 49 numbers that range from 1 to 49. A key component of this drawing is that it is done *without replacement*, meaning when one number is drawn, it is not put back into the set to be potentially chosen again. Also, the order of the numbers on the ticket do not matter for winning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Helper Functions to develop\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in order to answer the above questions, we,'ll need to create some functions that help us easily calculate **factorials** and the number of **combinations** (since, as stated above, the order does not matter for winning)."

Regardless of past performance, the probability is still the same as the output in the one_ticket_probability function above.\n",
